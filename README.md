# Hotel-management-using-java

The Hotel Management Project in Java is a comprehensive application designed to streamline hotel operations, including storing customer details, booking rooms, managing food orders, handling unbooking, and generating bills. To develop this project, I applied a range of programming and problem-solving skills, ensuring robust functionality and user-friendly experience.

Firstly, I utilized object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to structure the application. Classes were created to represent core entities such as Customer, Room, and FoodOrder, encapsulating attributes and behaviors relevant to each. This modular approach enhanced maintainability and scalability, as new features could be added with minimal impact on existing code.

I implemented data storage using Java collections like ArrayList to store dynamic lists of customers and bookings. This allowed for efficient searching, updating, and retrieval of records, which is crucial for a management system where information changes frequently.

For room management, I developed logic to handle various room types, ensuring that booking and unbooking operations respected room availability and avoided conflicts. Exception handling was employed to manage invalid inputs and edge cases gracefully, improving the system’s robustness and user trust.

Menu-driven interaction was achieved using command-line interfaces, allowing users to navigate through options for booking, food ordering, and billing. I paid particular attention to input validation and user feedback, ensuring the system responded clearly to user choices and errors.

Bill generation was automated by aggregating room charges and food orders associated with each customer. This involved precise calculations and careful association of data, leveraging Java’s control structures and method decomposition for clarity and correctness.

Throughout the project, I applied debugging and testing skills to identify and fix errors, ensuring reliable performance. By integrating these programming techniques and best practices, I delivered a functional, maintainable, and effective hotel management solution that mirrors real-world operations and demonstrates practical application of my Java development skills.
